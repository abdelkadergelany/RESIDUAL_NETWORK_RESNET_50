# RESIDUAL_NETWORK_RESNET_50
using a deeper network doesn't always help. A huge barrier to training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent prohibitively slow. tHIS PROBLEM CAN BE ADRESSED BY USING A RESIDUAL NETWORK
